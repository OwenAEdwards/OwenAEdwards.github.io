        <h3>Web Development</h3>
        <!-- TODO: mention LinkedIn certification for front-end web development -->
  
        <p>
          I was interested in building a portfolio website to display my projects.
          Learning the basics of HTML5 and CSS3 from front-end web development using Coursera throughout Summer 2022, I employed a website to GitHub.
          Refining the formatting of my website with Twitter Bootstrap, Google Fonts, and icons.
          Moreover, I learned the fundamentals of JavaScript and will be picking up React.JS for future use in web apps.

          <h3>Computer Science I: CS1021C</h3>
  
          <p>
            Computer Science I was my first-year computer science course in which we learned about fundamentals of object-oriented programming including encapsulation, abstraction, polymorphism, and inheritance.
            We discussed other lucrative topics such as operators, control flow, containers, functions, writing to files and headers, pointers, and recursion.
            Utilizing several standard C and C++ libraries, we learned the key differences between the two programming languages.
            I developed a final project with a technical report, analyzing algorithms I implemented in Python3 to solve math related questions on the website Project Euler.

          <h3>Engineering Design Thinking</h3>
          <!-- TODO: add Six Sigma, IBM Design Thinking Practioneer, and MS Office certs here...
               TODO: add links to BOTH "engineering design notebooks" to show I know what I'm doing 
               TODO: talk more about specifics i.e. how I did line-of-best-fit with Excel or accessing files through Python or
               arrays with MATLAB
              -->
  
          <p>
            Engineering Design Thinking I and Engineering Design Thinking II were my first-year engineering courses in which I learned several technical and interpersonal skills.
            Solving problems with flowcharting and documenting in problem-presentation method first, I then wrote programs to run computations on scientific and engineering formulae.
            Picking up Python3, MATLAB, and VBA macros in Excel for programming.
            We also discussed manipulating descriptive and inferential statistics with basic statistical modeling in Excel, which applied statistics I learned from high school. 
            Moreover, I employed these statistics in a multitude of lab reports over two semesters of science labs in my first-year: Chemistry I Lab and Physics I Lab.
            Although I believe the most useful skill sets I obtained from Engineering Design Thinking are cooperation in a diverse, team-oriented setting and project managing operations for technical reports.
            I had the pleasure of working in two sets of groups deploying a LEGO robot to walk in a straight line and pick items up, requiring mechanical and software knowledge to program the robot.
            My role in both groups was to write reports and document our endeavours with work breakdown structures, Gantt charts, workload distributions, and precedence networks with the critical path method.
            Garnering a role in leadership, I organized meetings between engineers successfully and ensured we pursued the Engineering Design Process.
            Particularly, identifying customer criteria/specifications, brainstorming, involving decision matrices in organizing solutions, and documenting test plans to enact these methods.

          <h3>Information Technology Certifications</h3>
  
          <p>
            Another means by which I have gained more technical skills is through obtaining IT certifications.
            I personally believe having a computer science degree with a background in IT will help me round out the applied theory of my degree with the applications of my certifications and projects.
            For instance, I obtained my CompTIA IT Fundamentals (ITF+) certification, covering basics in IT operations.
            Specifically, IT troubleshooting methodology, internal computing components, networking concepts, software application purposes and architecture, software development, database fundamentals, and best practices for secure devices.
            Also, I have experience with hardware components of computers from building a workstation computer for gaming while in high school.
            I understood the supply markets of semiconductors charging the pricing behind graphics cards and processors from this experience when COVID-19 shortages began.
            Additionally, I obtained my Microsoft Certified: Azure Fundamentals certification, proving my knowledge in cloud concepts.
            Principally, Microsoft Azure, cloud data, cloud networking, cloud security, cloud services (Iaas, Paas, and Saas), cloud storage, and virtualization vs. containerization.
